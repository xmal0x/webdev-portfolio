        <h4 className="mb-2">Hello everyone.</h4>
        <p>My name is Kirill, and I'm a web developer:)</p>
        <p>I've been involved in development for over 7 years now.
            I started with .NET on the backend but transitioned to full-stack development,
            and it seems that's where I truly appreciated the beauty of frontend work.
            For a long time, I worked with Angular, but recently,
            I've been captivated by React, and I can't seem to get enough of it at the moment.</p>
        <br/>
        <p>In my work, I highly value teamwork because, in my opinion,
            a good team can salvage a bad project, while a bad team can ruin a good project.
            I'm open to learning new things, i believe that continuous learning is the key to success in our industry.
            So feel free to reach out with any questions.</p>
        <br/>

        <p>
            Furthermore, aside from my work, I have a passion for traveling, playing the guitar, and indulging in street
            photography. I find these hobbies to be a great source of inspiration and creativity. I'm also the proud
            owner of a wonderful Griffon dog named Ozzy, who is my loyal companion on my adventures.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>If you have any projects, ideas, or simply interesting propositions,
            please don't hesitate to get in touch.
            I'm always ready for new challenges and look forward to the opportunity to
            collaborate with you.</p>
